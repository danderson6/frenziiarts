				  <li>Recently read a Report on the Design Economy in UK

						The Design Economy 2018 is the Design Council's report on 
						the state of design in the UK, and its value to the economy. 
						It expands on our previous research in 2015, and in addition 
						to exploring the supply of design firms and designers, also 
						explores how the rest of the UK business population interacts 
						with them, and what the demand for design is. <a href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/Design_Economy_2018_exec_summary.pdf">Read Now</a>
